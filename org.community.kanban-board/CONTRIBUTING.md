## How Can I Contribute?

### **Did you find a bug?**
* **Do not open up a GitHub issue ticket if the bug is a security vulnerability in the Kanban Board**, 
and instead mail me privately to address the problem.
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on the issue ticket under [Issues](https://github.com/d-ruiz/kdb_idempiere/issues).
**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a 
**title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** 
demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring, it is a good idea if you can reproduce the bug in one of the 
[iDempiere test servers](https://www.idempiere.org/test-sites) before you create a ticket.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of the plugin.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. If possible reproduce the problem with Garden data.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and videos** - if possible, which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
* **If you're reporting that iDempiere crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the log files. 
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include valid numbers.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem in [the test sites](https://www.idempiere.org/test-sites)?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of iDempiere) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of the Kanban plugin?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
