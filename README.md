## <b>Description</b>

This repository is a main project for several Idempiere Plugins shared and published for Idempiere Community from different sources.

The main objective of this repository is to share my personal developing environment for testing and build jar projects from original source code. I used it to prepare jar files to be installed on production later.

For more information on How to build idempiere Maven projects, see on Wiki: 

[Building iDempiere Plugins with Maven](https://wiki.idempiere.org/en/Building_iDempiere_Plugins_with_Maven)

These plugins can be generated by build.sh file provide on main directory.
